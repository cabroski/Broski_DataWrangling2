# Geospatial Data

## Introduction

Geospatial data are data that have some connection to specific places or
areas on Earth. In this lesson we will look at common geospatial data
types and how we can work with them in R. We will really be scratching
the surface today and you can find links to more resources at the end of
the lesson.

### Setup

To work with geospatial data in R, we usually need to install one or
more additional packages. The two most popular packages for geospatial
data are [terra](https://rspatial.org/pkg/) and
[sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/). In this lesson, we will only be
working with terra, and you can find links for more information on terra
and on sf at the bottom of the lesson. In order to use the terra
package, we must first install the package with `install.packages()`:

```{r terra-install}
library(terra)
```

And we load it into memory with the `library()` command:

```{r terra-load-print}

```

### Some Terms

Geospatial data generally come in one of two types: raster data or
vector data.

-   **Raster** data are gridded data. They generally look like images
    and have a fixed resolution. This means that as you zoom in on
    raster data, you eventually start seeing the grids. Like when you
    zoom in on a photograph and it becomes "pixelated" - we will see an
    example of this later. Raster data are usually quantitative
    measurements of some sort, such as temperature, precipitation, and
    reflectance in certain light wavelengths.
-   **Vector**, or shape, data are defined by specific coordinates on
    the Earth's surface and do not, technically, have a fixed
    resolution. This means that as you zoom in on Vector data, it never
    becomes "pixelated". Vector data usually take the form of points (a
    single pair of coordinates), lines (two or more coordinate pairs
    connected in a sequence), or polygons (three or more coordinate
    pairs connected in a closed sequence). Note: I apologize at this
    point for any confusion between the definition of geospatial vector
    data and the vector data structure in R. They are not the same
    thing, even though they probably have similar roots.

magnifyings](zoom-raster.png)

![Vector data do not lose resolution when magnifying](zoom-vector.png)

### Today's Destination

Today we will work with both raster and vector data, loading it into R,
doing some exploratory visualization, and modifying the data.
Ultimately, we are going to create a map of temperature data of
southwestern North America, highlighting those areas that are desert
biomes. At the end, we should have a map that looks like:

![Mean annual temperature of southwestern North
America](sw-desert-heat.png)

## Geospatial Raster Data

### Reading and Visualizing Raster Data

To read raster data into R, we use the `rast()` function from the terra
library; if you see an error that says something like
`Error in rast("global_temperature.tif") : could not find function "rast"`,
it probably means you need to load the terra library with
`library(terra)`.

```{r read-temperature-data}

```

With raster data, they will all (ideally) contain metadata - we can see
those metadata by running a line of code with the name of the variable
that that we read the raster into:

```{r print-temperature-data}

```

So there is a lot packed into the output. For our reality check, we will
just note that the data are global (see the values in the "extent"
field) and the range of values for mean annual temperature seem right
(see the "min value" and "max value" fields).

But come on! We are here for maps. Let us see a map! We can plot the
actual data stored in the raster with the `plot()` command.

```{r plot-global-temperature-data}

```

### Aside: `plot()` actually means a lot of different things.

A quick note that when we call `plot()`, R will take a look at what
information we passed to the function, then decide which *version* of
the `plot()` function to use. We will not go into additional detail
here, but consider looking at the documentation for the base R version
of `plot()` (via `?plot`) and comparing that with the version that comes
with the terra package (via `?terra::plot`).

### Cropping data

Rarely do we need a map of the entire globe. Rather, we often want to
focus on parts of the globe. In this lesson we are going to focus on
southwestern North America, so we need to crop our raster data to that
region. In order to do this we first define what is called a geographic
extent. This is basically a fancy way of drawing a line around the area
we are interested in. In our case, we need to define the geographic
limits of what we are calling the southwest; i.e. the easternmost,
westernmost, southernmost, and northernmost points.

> Question: how would you find the latitude and longitude values to
> define this extent?

For this lesson, we can get away with using whole degree values; we will
use decimal degrees later in the lesson. When defining an area with four
values (easternmost, westernmost, etc.), we need to be sure to get them
in the right order. Often (but *not* always), they are in the following
order:

1.  xmin = westernmost
2.  xmax = easternmost
3.  ymin = southernmost
4.  ymax = northernmost

```{r define-southwest}
# Lower right: 21, -98
# Upper left: 46, -126

```

You will also note that we used negative values for those western
hemisphere longitudes (-126, -98). The same goes for values in the
southern hemisphere.

> Question: Why would we use negative values instead of the letters W
> and S for western longitudes and southern latitudes, respectively?

We can do a reality check and print out the value by running the name of
the extent.

```{r print-extent}

```

Finally, we can make a new map, with only those values in the area we
defined by our geographic extent with the `crop()` function from terra.

```{r crop-temperature-data}

```

We can then compare the objects of our original raster:

```{r uncropped-temp}

```

to the cropped raster:

```{r cropped-temp}

```

Just about all the data changed, with the exception of the value in the
`coord. ref.` field. We will talk more about that field later.

Let us look at the map of our cropped data, again with the `plot()`
function.

```{r plot-cropped-temp}

```

### Modifying data

The *really* nice thing about modern geospatial package in R is that we
can do operations on every cell of the data. For example maybe we want
to convert our temperature values from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

> Question: For our cropped data, how many calculations would this
> conversion require?

A reminder of the formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit:

$$
F = (C \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32
$$

```{r temp-conversion}
# (C * 9/5) + 32 = F
temp_sw_f <- (temp_sw * 9/5) + 32
```

And plotting the data, the image looks the pretty much the same, but
note the scale is different:

```{r plot-fahrenheit}

```

### Aside: The world is not flat, so why is my map?

> Question: What are some differences between the map we see on our
> screen and reality?

The process of taking the three-dimensional shape of the Earth and
presenting it in a two-dimensional format (i.e. a map) is called
projection and there are several ways of doing this. And when I say
several, I actually mean infinite. From the [Wikipedia page on map
projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections):
"Because there is no limit to the number of possible map projections,
there can be no comprehensive list." However, there are common ones that
you should probably stick to.

When working in R, the coordinate reference system describes how the
three- dimensional data are transformed into two-dimensional space.

Let us look once more at our cropped temperature raster metadata.

```{r show-wgs84}

```

Specifically, we see the value in the coord. ref. field is

`lon/lat WGS 84 (EPSG:4326)`

Without going into too much detail, this tells us it uses the World
Geodetic System 84 reference system with latitude and longitude. This is
a pretty good one to use as long as your maps aren't super close to the
poles. *All* projections from three-dimensional space to two-dimensional
space result in some distortions, and this one really stretches out area
near the poles. You can see this in action by plotting your original
map:

```{r show-pole-distortion}

```

Look at Antarctica! It's huge!

We can change the way our map looks by re-projecting the raster. That
is, we make a new object in R that uses a different coordinate reference
system. You might have noticed in the coord. ref. field that there was
the extra bit of text in parentheses: "(EPSG:4326)". Thankfully there is
a set of unique identifiers for all the different coordinate reference
systems and we can use those identifiers to re-project our data. These
identifiers all start with the letters "epsg" and end with a series of
four to five numbers.

As an example, we can re-project our southwest temperature data to a
projection that does not distort the area quite as much. We do this with
the terra function `project()` and then plot the result:

```{r reproject-temp}


```

> Question: What is the name of the coordinate system that EPSG 5070
> refers to?

### Colors on maps

So, we have a map, but these colors make me think of elevation, not
temperature, so how can we change this? Let's start by looking at the
documentation one of the functions for creating color palettes, called
`rainbow()`:

```{r color-documentation, eval = FALSE}
# Brings up R documentation for some color palettes

```

This actually brings up documentation for a bunch of palettes, but
looking at the entry in the **Usage** section for `rainbow()`, we see
that we need to give it a value for the number of colors, `n`. Let us
try passing the rainbow palette to the plot function, giving it fifty
colors:

```{r rainbow-colors}

```

Well, the colors changed, but I would not say for the better. In fact,
when I go about making decisions about colors, my go-to resource is
ColorBrewer at <https://colorbrewer2.org>.

You can click through the options and it will display the different
palettes. For our purposes, the Yellow-Orange-Brown palette ("YlOrBr")
should work well. To see the name of the palette, look just to the left
of the "EXPORT" tab:

![Example of palette name in ColorBrewer,
YlOrBr](colorbrewer-palette-name.png)

To use these palettes, we replace the `rainbow()` function with the
`hcl.colors()` function, and indicate which palette we want through the
`palette` argument:

```{r pick-colors}

```

This is close, but I'd rather reverse the scale, so darker colors
indicate hotter temperatures. I am going to create a variable that
stores these colors so I do not have to keep writing out the
`hcl.colors()` specification.

```{r reverse-colors}


```

> Question: What are the values stored in the `temp_cols` variable?

## Geospatial Vector Data

Now we will switch to vector data, which are all based on coordinates.
These data commonly come as points (a single pair of coordinates), lines
(multiple pairs of coordinates), or polygons (multiple pairs of
coordinates that define a geographical area).

### Adding Points

Let us create a data frame with some city coordinates that we can add to
the map.

```{r city-data-frame}

```

To make these data easier to work with our raster object, we are going
to transform it to a spatial vector, or SpatVector in terra-speak. While
we are at it, we will tell it to use the same coordinate reference
system as the temperature data we already loaded in.

```{r cities-vector}

```

Looking at the SpatVector object, it doesn't really look very different.

```{r print-cities-vector}

```

Now we can make our map and add those points to the map. Make sure to
use `add = TRUE` in our second call to `plot()` so it adds the points to
the already existing map.

```{r add-cities-points}


```

Finally, because we stored the names of the cities in our data frame, we
can also add those.

```{r add-cities-names}



```

### Adding Areas (aka Polygons)

What if we want to add areas, not just points, to our map? Here is where
we get into the realm of polygons. We can do things like add polygons
from shapefiles that we download or export from a program like ArcGIS.
For this lesson, though, we are going to make a polygon on the fly and
add that to our map.

Going back to our original goal of a map highlighting desert biomes, we
will define a desert as an area that receives less than 250 millimeters
of precipitation per year (*Aside*: this definition only goes so far;
for example, the city of Tucson does not, technically, get counted as
being a desert because it receives an average of 300 mm of precipitation
per year. You can read more about [defining deserts on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert#Defining_characteristics)).

So we start by loading in a file with global precipitation data:

```{r read-precipitation-data}


```

Then cropping those data to the North American southwest (that we
defined above).

```{r crop-precipitaton-data}


```

And it is usually good to do a reality check and plot the data, too:

```{r plot-precipitation-data}

```

Cool. Map looks good and the ranges of precipitation seem reasonable,
too. Now we need to use this information to identify those areas
considered deserts. We will use this categorization to draw an outline
of desert biomes on our temperature map. As we talked about before, we
will use the precipitation-based definition of a desert, where any spot
that received less than 250 mm in annual precipitation is categorized as
a desert. We start by defining our cutoff and then creating a new raster
based on values in the precipitation raster.

```{r define-desert}



```

Looking at the raster metadata, we see the big difference is the min and
max values - they aren't numbers anymore, but are now logicals (`FALSE`
and `TRUE`). This is because what we stored in the `prec_desert` object
was the output of a comparison. That is, for each cell in our southwest
precipitation raster, `prec_sw`, we asked if the value in that cell was
less than 250 mm. The answer is either `TRUE` or `FALSE`, so that is
what is stored in the resulting output raster, `prec_desert`. We can
also see this when we plot the output:

```{r plot-desert-logical}

```

The areas that are lighting up in green are those "desert" biomes. For
now, we are going to ignore the limitations of our precipitation-based
definition (i.e. the southern portion of the Central Valley of
California is not generally considered a desert).

To add this to our map, though, we do not want a logical raster, rather,
we want a polygon, in order to draw a border around the deserts. We
start by changing all the `FALSE` values to missing (`NA`) - if we did
not do this, R would make *two* polygons from the data, one for desert
areas and one for "not desert" areas. We then use the `as.polygons()`
function to do the transformation and plot the polygon alone as a
reality check.

```{r desert-to-polygon}
# Change all FALSE values to missing data

# Convert remaining non-missing values to a polygon (vector data)

# Plot polygons (reality check)

```

Looking good! Now we can plot our temperature map again and add the
polygon to the map. Feel free to experiment with arguments to change the
colors and transparency of the desert polygon (hint: look at the
documentation for the `polys()` function via `?polys` for details on how
to do this).

```{r add-desert}
# Plot base temperature map

# Add desert polygon

```

Finally, because we are being pedantic, let us make the plot again, this
time adding a title explaining what the colors mean ("00B0" is Unicode
for the degree symbol).

```{r add-title}



```

And if you are inclined, you can output this map by wrapping all the
plotting commands within a call to one of the graphics device functions
(e.g. `png()`, `pdf()`) and then turning off this graphical redirect
with `dev.off()`.

```{r save-plot}

plot(temp_sw, col = temp_cols, 
     main = "Mean Annual Temperature (\u00B0C)")
polys(x = desert_poly)

```

## Glossary

These are the functions we used in this lesson; use the `?` in R to find
more details (e.g. `?rast`). The following are from the terra package:

-   `as.polygons`: Convert a raster object into a polygon (shape)
    object.
-   `crop`: Crop the geographic extent of a raster.
-   `ext`: Create a SpatExtent (spatial extent) object.
-   `plot`: Um, plot?
-   `polys`: Add polygons to an existing plot.
-   `project`: Change the projection of a geospatial object.
-   `rast`: Read in a raster file (`rast()` does more than this, too,
    but this is what we used it for here).
-   `text`: Add text to an existing plot.

And we used a few from base R, too:

-   `dev.off`: Stop writing to a graphics output file.
-   `hcl.colors`: Create a vector of color values based on a palette.
-   `png`: Start writing to a PNG graphics file.
-   `rainbow`: Create a vector of unicorn-vomit colors.
-   `rev`: Reverse the order of values in a vector.
